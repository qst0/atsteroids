# C++ Piscine Rush00

## First Steps:

Check out the ncurses demo folder for some examples.

Will be adding online resources soon too.

Even more experementation:
I have a ball bouncing, well, the char '0'
bouncing around the window.
Resize works, and I have an included window demo.
Now to make this a game.

## Intructions:

* Make sure this is a `C++` program not a `C` or `C+` program.
* Make sure all functions are in Copliens Form.
* Your program must be compiled with a Makefile
* The executable must be named ft\_retro

The goal of this project is to implement a simplistic shoot-em-up
style game in your terminal.

You will use a screen made up of a grid of 'squares'.
These can be equated to the characters on your terminal.
Entities of your game are each represented by a character on the screen.

Basic Requirements:

* Single-player mode
* Display using the ncurses library
* Horizontal or vertical scrolling
* Random Enemies
* The player can shoot at enemies
* Basic collision handling (if an enemy touches you, you die!)
* Game entities occupy one 'square' of the map only.
* Frame-based timing

Steps:

* Acquire input
* Update game entities
* Render display
* Repeat until end of game

### When all of this is done, refer to the subject for bonus.
