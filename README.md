## First Steps:

Working through this tutorial to make a game:

https://github.com/fundamelon/terminal-game-tutorial

This just has "Hello World!" a `box()` border and player movement.

It's really a great start though!

Check out the ncurses demo folder for other examples.

## Game Ideas:

??? - Space Dodger (Just like the tutorial for now!)

## Intructions:

* Make sure this is a `C++` program not a `C` or `C+` program.
* Make sure all functions are in Copliens Form.
* Your program must be compiled with a Makefile
* The executable must be named ft\_retro

The goal of this project is to implement a simplistic shoot-em-up
style game in your terminal.

You will use a screen made up of a grid of 'squares'.
These can be equated to the characters on your terminal.
Entities of your game are each represented by a character on the screen.

Basic Requirements:

* Single-player mode
* Display using the ncurses library
* Horizontal or vertical scrolling
* Random Enemies
* The player can shoot at enemies
* Basic collision handling (if an enemy touches you, you die!)
* Game entities occupy one 'square' of the map only.
* Frame-based timing

Steps:

* Acquire input
* Update game entities
* Render display
* Repeat until end of game

### When all of this is done, refer to the subject for bonus.
